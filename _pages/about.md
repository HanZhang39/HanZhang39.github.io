I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California.
My advisor is Prof. Sven Koenig.
Prior to my Ph.D., I got my master's degree in Computer Science from USC and my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tongji University in Shanghai.

My research interest is in heuristic search, planning, and Artificial Intelligence.
During my Ph.D., I work on the Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem and the Multi-Objective Search problem.
