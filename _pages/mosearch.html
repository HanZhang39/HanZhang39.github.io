This page summarizes my research on the multi-objective search problem.
I also include the pointers to the papers and the code.

<h2>Overview </h2><hr />

The multi-objective search problem is the problem of finding paths from a start state to a goal state in a graph where each edge is annotated with multiple costs. A typical task of multi-objective search is to find the Pareto frontier, that is, the set of all undominated paths from the start state to the goal state. This problem is important for many applications, such as transporting hazardous materials, where travel distance and risk are two costs that need to be considered.

    <figcaption>The above figure shows an example problem of multi-objective search with two objectives, namely, travel distance and travel time. We need to find paths from home to the burger place. The Pareto frontier contains two paths: The red path has the smallest travel distance, and the blue path has the smallest travel time. Other paths, for example, the orange path, are dominated by either the red or the blue path.</figcaption>

<h2>My Ph.D. dissertation </h2><hr />

<p>
While researchers have developed various techniques over the past years for speeding up single-objective searches on large graphs, many of them have not been investigated in the context of multi-objective search.
In my dissertation, I hypothesize that one can speed up multi-objective search algorithms by applying insights gained from single-objective search algorithms after proper generalization. Specifically, I consider the following four classes of techniques that have been used to speed up single-objective search algorithms, namely, (1) by trading off solution quality with efficiency, (2) by anytime search, (3) by preprocessing techniques, and (4) by efficient data structures for time-consuming operations.

<h3>Approximate search</h3>

We propose A*pex, an approximate multi-objective search algorithm that computes an \(\varepsilon\)-approximate Pareto frontier for a user-specified \(\varepsilon\)-value. We showed that an approximate Pareto frontier can be computed much faster than the Pareto frontier.

<div style="width:80%;    margin-left: auto;

    <figcaption>
        The Pareto frontier (9114 solutions), a 0.001-approximate Pareto frontier (30 solutions), and a 0.01-approximate Pareto frontier (4 solutions) computed by BOA*, A*pex with \(\varepsilon=0.001\), and A*pex with \( \varepsilon=0.01 \), respectively, for a road-network problem instance with two objectives.
        While it takes BOA* 170 seconds to compute the Pareto frontier, it takes A*pex, our proposed algorithm, only 15 seconds and 7 seconds to compute the approximate Pareto frontiers with \(\varepsilon = 0.001\) and \(\varepsilon = 0.01\), respectively.

<h3>Anytime search</h3>


We propose A-A*pex, an anytime approximate multi-objective search algorithm that quickly computes an approximate Pareto frontier and, while time allows, works on computing more solutions until it finds the Pareto frontier.
Such an anytime algorithm could be useful if one only has a limited amount of runtime available for solving a multi-objective search problem instance.

        The solutions found by BOA* (existing algorithm) and A-A*pex (our proposed algorithm) for a bi-objective search problem instance on the FLA road network. Different markers indicate different time ranges when the solutions were found.
        If one is given a limited amount of time, for example, 1s, 10s, or 100s, running A-A*pex results in solutions that are much better distributed than those of the solutions found by BOA*.

<h3>Contraction hierarchies</h3>
<p>
In single-objective search, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies">contraction hierarchy </a> is a speed-up technique for quickly computing the shortest path.
We show that contraction hierarchies can be generalized to multi-objective search as well, resulting in orders-of-magnitude speed-up.

<h3>Data structures</h3>
For multi-objective search algorithms, dominance checks are often the most time-consuming operations.
We propose the bucket array, a data structure for speeding up the dominance checks.

<h2>Other works </h2><hr />

Aside from the works I included in the dissertation, I am also involved in the following works that are related to multi-objective search.

<h3> Optimal search algorithms </h3>

<h3> Speed-up techniques </h3> 

We have generalized differential heuristics (DHs), another speed-up technique for single-objective search, to the bi-objective search [1].
We have also proposed to speed up dominance checks via vectorized operations offered by Single Instruction/Multiple Data (SIMD) [2].

<h3> Applications </h3> 

We have applied the multi-objective search techniques to other problems, including the multi-objective multi-agent path finding problem [1,2,3], the weight-constrained shortest path problem [4], and the bounded-cost bi-objective search problem [5].
